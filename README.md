# Music App player with PHP API

Music App player was created for my personal use and it combined with React & PHP API as a backend.

## First, install all the dependencies

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

## Script for development mode

You can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Script for production mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
